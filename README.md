Explanation of how the Huffman frequency tree is built in the code is given the demonstration videos, otherwise the code itself has been commented properly.

**What I am summitting:** I am submitting a working lossless compressor software that is based on the Huffman algorithm. I programmed it by myself for a course titled, CSC440:Design and Analysis of Algorithms.

**Why I choose this Code:** I do not have permission to share any of the professionalwork that I have done in Java, Python, or C++, therefore I choose to submit past work that I programmed entirely on my own. I also choose it because it is simple, short and stand-alone working software.

**My Contribution to the code:** The coding was entirely done by me, however it is based on the famous Huffman greedy algorithm. There were some restrictions on what we could use for the assignment, so this code is completely different than other online solutions.

**Design choices:** I chose basic data structures because the assignment specified that we should not utilize any advanced data structures, such as hash tables or hash maps for this assignment. We were strictly instructed to build a frequency tree is based on Huffman algorithm. The rest of design is to support that choice.

#### How to run the software:
**Requirements:** *To run this software you need Python 2.7. As the coding was doneseveral years ago, the software is not compatible with Python 3.*
You will also need a txt file to compress. I am providing pride.txt file in the source code to test. Instructions and demonstration begin at 4:24 in the linked video. 
**To Run:** It can be run through command line.
*To compress type on command line:*

python Huffman.py -c filename_to_be_compressed filename_of_compressed_file.

*To decompress a file type on command line:*

python Huffman.py -c filename_of_compressed_file Decompressed_filename
